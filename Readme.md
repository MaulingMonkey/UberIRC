C# IRC Client.  I should probably rename it after someone started a network with the same name - I was here first though ;)

# Features

* /semiignore Disables highlighting and reducing text visibility of people who are annoying, but not worth banning.
* /twitlist   Helps me highlight likely ban evaders (e.g. comming from *tor*) for review, in case I wish to re-ban.
* Tiny tiny fonts!  Because even with 4K monitors, I want more text onscreen.
* Screenshot upload!  Currently broken due to imageshack API changes.  Ctrl+Shift+V for easy sharing of screenshots from my clipboard, though.
